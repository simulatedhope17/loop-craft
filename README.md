# LoopCraft

LoopCraft is a multi-track audio looping application designed for both mobile and desktop use. It allows users to easily record, overdub, and arrange audio loops to create musical ideas or full tracks. The application aims to provide intuitive controls and essential features for a smooth looping workflow.

## Features

Here are the planned features for LoopCraft:

### Core Features (Must-Have)

*   **Multi-Track Looping:** Record, overdub, and play multiple loops in parallel (e.g., rhythm, chords, melody).
*   **Clear Visual Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback for each track (e.g., waveform, progress bar).
*   **Intuitive Controls:** Offer one-tap record/overdub/stop/clear controls.
*   **Undo/Redo:** Implement Undo/Redo for the last recording action.
*   **Time Stretching & Tempo Sync:** Include auto-detection of tempo or manual BPM adjustment and the ability to sync loops to a global tempo (quantization).
*   **Low Latency:** Ensure near real-time monitoring for live playing.
*   **Basic Effects:** Provide basic effects like Reverb, Delay, EQ, and Distortion for polishing loops.
*   **Export/Save Loops:** Allow WAV/MP3 export and project saving (local storage or cloud).
*   **Metronome & Count-In:** Offer an optional pre-record metronome (1-2 bars) for tight timing.
*   **Mobile/Desktop Friendly:** Design a touch-friendly UI for mobile and consider keyboard shortcuts for desktop.

### Advanced Features (Nice-to-Have)

*   **MIDI Support:** Connect MIDI controllers (e.g., foot pedals for hands-free control).
*   **AI-Assisted Features:** Explore features like auto-harmonization or drum/bass generation.
*   **Reverse Playback & Pitch Shifting:** Add capabilities for reversed loops or octave shifts.
*   **Collaboration Mode:** Enable sharing loops online for remote jamming.
*   **Customizable Grid/Quantization:** Support for odd time signatures or freeform looping.
*   **Sampler Integration:** Allow importing short samples/one-shots alongside loops.
*   **Visualizations:** Include visualizations like a spectrum analyzer or piano roll.
